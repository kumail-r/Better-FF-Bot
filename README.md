# Better-FF-Bot

A tightly focused FFXIV centered Discord bot that only has funcionality that I deem to be important and is not bloated like many popular FFXIV Discord bots that have so many commands that they are overwhelming to use for many users. Designed originally for personal use however you may use the source code however you want if you are interested.

Currently implemented functionality:

- Display user lodestone data
- Display marketboard data using Universalis API
- Ping
- Weekly fashion report

Planned Features (not in order):

- Reaction roles
- have custom output for the player information sheet (perhaps something like Kupo Bot's implementation)
- FFLogs integration (simple commands to do different things - perhaps one to check if user has cleared current tier, and if so by how much and at what percentiles)
- Retrieve portrait, retrieve thumbnail
- Minigames
- Timers/reminders for in game and custom announcements
- Polling
